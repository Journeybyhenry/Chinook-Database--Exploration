# Chinook-Database--Exploration

## Introduction
In this project, we queried the Chinook Database. The Chinook Database holds information about a music store. For this project, I assisted the Chinook team with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information.

## Project Learning Outcome
üìö Learning about various SQL commands, including Joins, Aggregations, Subqueries & Temporary Tables, Window Functions, and Data Cleaning.

üîç Posing the right questions to help generate insights for the company's executives and writing SQL queries to provide the answers to these questions.

üìà Leveraging the results obtained from the SQL on DB Browser to export the data and create visualizations for presentation to an end-user.

## Key Insights Derived
 - Berlin led Germany for the highest sales volume, boasting a total of $75.24, followed by Frankfurt and Stuttgart
 - In Germany, the most profitable genre by far is Rock, raking in a substantial total of $61.38 for Chinook. Rock has decisively outperformed all other genres in the country.
 - Fynn Zimmermann stood out as the top customer in terms of order amount, although the variance compared to other customers was relatively minimal.
 - Rock reigns as the best-selling genre in Europe, boasting an astonishing lead of 425 purchases, with Latin and the Alternative & Punk genres following behind.
